Originally from Indonesia, studying in Japan has been an enriching experience that has broadened my perspectives on global affairs. At TIU, I'm actively involved in exploring the complexities of international relations while embracing the cultural diversity and academic rigor that Japan offers. It's a journey that not only deepens my academic knowledge but also enhances my understanding of global dynamics and cross-cultural interactions.</p>
